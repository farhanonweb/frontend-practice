# frontend-practice
This repository contains my practice work in frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.   It includes topic-wise code files that focus on core web development concepts such as structure, styling, and interactivity.   The goal of this repository is to strengthen my fundamentals and build a solid foundation for modern web development.
